🌾 Interactive Crop Yield Dashboard
Overview
This interactive web application enables users to explore maize yield patterns across different subcounties and climatic conditions over the years. It’s built with Dash, a Python framework for creating data apps using Plotly visualizations.

Features
📊 Subcounty Selection: View yield dynamics specific to a chosen subcounty.

📈 Climate & Vegetation Variable Selection: Analyze how factors like rainfall, temperature, NDVI, or EVI relate to yield.

🎨 Year-wise Coloring: Easily compare trends across years using color-coded scatter plots.

🔍 Interactive Exploration: Hover to see exact values, zoom into specific regions, and filter insights visually.

Use Cases
Policy Planning: Identify underperforming or climate-resilient subcounties.

Agricultural Research: Evaluate how climatic stressors impact crop yield.

Farmer Advisory Services: Use insights to recommend planting strategies.

Education & Awareness: Help students and stakeholders visualize real-world agri-climate relationships.
